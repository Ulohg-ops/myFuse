### Objective: 
This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of file system operations and encryption mechanisms by building a simple in-memory file system using the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) framework, followed by integrating AES-256 encryption to ensure data security.

### 實驗
Part1:Setting Up FUSE environment
Install the FUSE library if not already installed. Use the package manager of your Linux distribution, for example, sudo apt-get install fuse libfuse-dev
